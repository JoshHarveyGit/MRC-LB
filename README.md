# Exeter MRC Lewy Body Project.
This repository covers scripts used for the analysis of DNA methylation and genotyping data for the Exeter MRC Lewy Body project

## Cohort Summary
Data for this project was generated from 941 unique samples from 474 individuals. Diagnoses of each covered clinical Parkinson's Disease, Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) across a range of neuropathological stages. Where possible, two brain regions were included for each sample: the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (CNG; BA24/32) and the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC; BA9). 

## Data types and repository structure
In total, DNA was profiled using two array platforms. Genome wide DNA methylation was quantified using the [Infinium MethylationEPIC Array](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/infinium-methylation-epic.html) and genotyped using the [Infinium Global Screening Array](https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/microarray-kits/infinium-global-screening.html).
